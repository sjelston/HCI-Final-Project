            <p>People are an essential part of every computational system. The usefulness of any computation ultimately depends on the input provided by and the output interpreted by users. Using apps on a mobile device, surfing web pages in a browser, writing
                letters in a text editor, performing calculations in a spreadsheet, editing computer programs in a development environment, and implementing and testing entirely new algorithms in a command language, are but a few of the everyday activities
                that people perform through interaction with computational systems.</p>

            <p>This course introduces the theory and practice of human-computer interaction, with a focus on the graphical user interfaces that make up the modern human-centric computing experience. Topics include fundamental principles of human-computer
                interaction, interface design and analysis, human cognitive and perceptual capabilities and limitations, desktop/window systems, and social implications of computing. You will learn about current graphic user interface development tools
                and programming libraries, and complete a semester-long team-oriented project that provides realistic experience with human-computer interaction from developer, designer, and end-user perspectives.</p>
            <p>Students enrolled in CS 5063 will develop an extra facet of their teamâ€™s project, and also individually implement and analyze an interaction technique from a research paper, as the two parts of their additional course workload.</p>
